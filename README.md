# Jaren-Harmon-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Jaren Harmon 👋
Aerospace Engineer | CAD Designer | Creative Technologist

I am an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Kansas (Class of '27) with a passion for propulsion, flight dynamics, and interactive software. I don't just design systems; I build the tools to analyze them and the interfaces to showcase them. 

Currently, I'm specializing in propulsion system design and high-fidelity simulations, while teaching myself full-stack development to bridge the gap between physical engineering and digital tools.

💻 Software & Creative Projects
Flight Dynamics Analysis Tool
A custom learning tool designed to visualize the movement and interaction of an F-22 model with the flight dynamics forces, moments, and derivatives.

Propulsion Modeling and Envoronmental Factoring Tool
In Development A custom tool designed to output engine efficiency base off of environmental factors due to location in the world. 
Goal: take into account real temperature data and altitude as well as other factors like coastal and city proximity for salt concentration and other pollutants in the air. 

Academic Projects
Misc. academic projects for lectures and team based assignments.

Web-Based Game Development
I build interactive 3D and 2D experiences using JavaScript and Three.js to explore physics engines and graphics rendering.

3D Wizard Arena: A browser-based 3D combat-upgrade game.

FPS Knight: (Current WIP) A first person, low-poly PvE 

2D Platformers: Various experiments with collision detection and level design.
