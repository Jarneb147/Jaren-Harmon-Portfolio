# Jaren-Harmon-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Jaren Harmon 👋
Aerospace Engineer | CAD Designer | Creative Technologist

I am an Aerospace Engineering student at the University of Kansas (Class of '27) with a passion for propulsion, flight dynamics, and interactive software. I don't just design systems; I build the tools to analyze them and the interfaces to showcase them. 

Currently, I'm specializing in propulsion system design and high-fidelity simulations, while teaching myself full-stack development to bridge the gap between physical engineering and digital tools.

🚀 Featured Engineering Projects
Argonia Cup Rocket - Propulsion Lead
August 2025 – Present Leading the propulsion design for a two-stage high-powered rocket targeting an apogee of 27,000 ft.


The Build: Optimized motor staging for supersonic flight using OpenRocket and MATLAB.


The Impact: Achieved a stable apogee of 7.54 calibers while minimizing motor impulse (4900 N-s) to maximize competition scoring.

Remote Monitored Temperature Controller
May 2025 – August 2025 A wireless IoT solution to monitor thermal variances in industrial emissions testing.


The Build: Prototyped a data acquisition system using Arduino and wrote C++ firmware to transmit telemetry over a local mesh Wi-Fi network.


The Impact: Eliminated manual monitoring "waste," streamlining labor and increasing production efficiency.

Automated Taping System
May 2025 – June 2025 A custom manufacturing machine designed to automate the thermal wrapping of gas transport dongles.


The Build: Designed the mechanical feeding system in SolidWorks, utilizing gear-driven friction for application.


The Impact: Reduced cycle time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes—a 500% efficiency increase.

💻 Software & Creative Projects
Flight Dynamics Analysis Tool
In Development A custom propulsion analysis program built to automate complex calculations for Flight Dynamics coursework. This tool replaces manual spreadsheet analysis with a programmatic approach to stability and control derivatives.
